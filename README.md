Radar-Communication Waveform Classification
The convergence of radar and communications systems in 6G networks introduces a critical challenge: spectrum congestion. To tackle this, we propose a deep learning-based approach for efficient waveform classification, which is vital for resource-constrained Cognitive Radio-enabled Internet of Things (CR-IoT) devices.

üîç Overview
We develop a cost-effective deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns essential radio features from time-frequency representations of signals. The model incorporates attention modules to:

Significantly reduce network complexity

Maintain high classification accuracy

üìä Dataset & Evaluation
Our experiments are conducted on a dataset of attenuated signals consisting of eight types of radar and communication waveforms. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed network in classifying various signal types under realistic channel conditions.
